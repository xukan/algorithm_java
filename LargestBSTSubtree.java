/*Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.

Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.
Here's an example:
    10
    / \
   5  15
  / \   \ 
 1   8   7
The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. 
The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
Follow up:
Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
