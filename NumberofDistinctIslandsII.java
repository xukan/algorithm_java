//Count the number of distinct islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, 
//or have the same shape after rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down direction).

/*
 * 11               1
 * 1     and     11   are same,  Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.
 * 
 * 111           1
 * 1    aand    111 are same,  Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.
